## MLK TDD

In the `spec/` folder is an Rspec file with the contents of MLK's famous "I have a dream speech." Your job is to make each of those dreams a reality!

Write only the code necessary to make each test pass, so just write the necessary code to fix the error at hand.

Read your errors & zen out!

Put code in `lib/dream.rb`. Run `rspec` from the current directory.
